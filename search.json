    "text": "There has been a lot of online ruckus about how AI is stifling the creation of art and originality. However, I beg to differ. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt believe that AI should be used to write full movie scripts or to create paintings that belong in the Louvre, but as I thought about some of the possibilities we can do with LLMs, I was intrigued. So I decided to see just how much creative damage I could do‚Äì beginning with creating a new color.\nI start with asking Bing‚Äôs Copilot:\ncreate a new color\nThe LLM responds very kindly giving me lots of imaginative options to choose from:\nCertainly! Creating a new color can be a delightful and imaginative process. While I can‚Äôt mix actual pigments, I can certainly help you conceptualize a unique color. Let‚Äôs embark on this colorful journey together!\n\nSunset Coral: Imagine a warm blend of rosy pink and golden orange, reminiscent of a vibrant sunset over the ocean. This color exudes warmth, energy, and a touch of romance.\nStardust Teal: Picture a deep, mystical shade that combines the richness of midnight blue with a hint of emerald green.\nMoonstone Lavender: Close your eyes and envision a soft, ethereal hue‚Äîpale lavender with a subtle shimmer, like moonlight dancing on water. It‚Äôs calming, dreamy, and perfect for serene spaces.\nGalactic Plum: Take the intensity of royal purple and infuse it with cosmic energy. This color feels otherworldly, like a distant galaxy swirling in shades of plum and indigo.\n\nRemember, these colors exist only in our imagination, but you can play with them in your mind or even use them as inspiration for your next creative project! üåà‚ú®\nI was the most curious about Stardust Teal and Moonstone Lavender, but I couldn‚Äôt help but think that I‚Äôve seen very similar variations of these colors already‚Ä¶ meaning it didn‚Äôt do it‚Äôs job in creating a new color. So I decided to find a color that I thought matched closest to the description and see how different it is the what Copilot created for me."

    "text": "Closing Remarks\nIt would be interesting to see how different Copilot is to Dall-E 3 in interpreting color descriptions, but if Dall-E 3 and I agree for 2/2, then I think Copilot must be pretty similar as well.\nAfter all of this, I think it‚Äôs important to note that I was not blown away or shocked by either of these colors, and it‚Äôs because I have seen them before. This means that AI cannot create new colors‚Ä¶ at least, not with the prompt that I supplied it with this time.\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"

    "text": "Since Barbie hit theaters last summer, I‚Äôm sure audiences have thought about how the world would be if only Kens‚Äô existed and conversely, if only Barbies wandered the streets. Would humanity flourish with only one gender? If so, for how long? I‚Äôm interested in AI‚Äôs visual portrayal of the world without men and the world without women after 1 day, 1 year, and 10 years in the future. Let‚Äôs get started!\nUsing Dall-E 3, I prompted the LLM to ‚ÄúCreate an image of a city one day after all men have disappeared.‚Äù\n\nFirst Attempt\nThe LLM must have assumed that ‚Äúmen‚Äù referred to all humans (which is an interesting note for another time), because the picture it printed was quite melancholic and a man still appeared.\n\nFor the next try, I used the prompt: Create an image of a city one day after all men have disappeared, but women are alive and well.\nI will be using this format for all the prompts ahead, i.e.¬†Create an image of a city one ____ after all _____ have disappeared, but _______ are alive and well.\n\n\nOne Day Without Men\nThis time the LLM changed its course ‚ÄìI think finally understanding my request‚Äì and outputted this normal city.\n\nI think it‚Äôs nice that the LLM even added a pretty sunset! Lights are off, so I‚Äôm sure the world is in shock wondering where all the men went.\n\n\nOne Year Without Men\n\nThe next image was generated with the same prompt except 1 year instead of 1 day, and it gave us a very similar skyline. I think something that could be interpreted from this image is no major buildings were added in the year since men left. Also, all the lights are off again signaling that maybe no one occupies these buildings anymore.\n\n\n10 Years Without Men\n\nThis take looks the most lively. It‚Äôs as if the women moved into these buildings and started to make some changes in the last few years. This shows women have come together and that civilization survives!\n\n\nOne Day Without Women\n\nI interpret this visual as a quiet city and no one knows what to do because all the women just disappeared, so they have called off the day from work.\n\n\nOne Year Without Women\n\nAfter a year, the men are used to things and they are up and running quicker than the women were for comparison at this point in time.\n\n\nTen Years Without Women\n\nI assume this dark city means that men did not find a way to repopulate the Earth, leaving the buildings dark and empty after 10 years without women.\n\n\nClosing Remarks\nThis was an interesting exercise solely based on my curiosity with how I thought AI would deliver visuals based on gender. I guess I imagined more of a bias in terms of more technology with the men and more nature with the women or something along those lines. Either way, I think this idea could be explored more, but for now it seems like we would be best off if both Barbies and Kens stuck around!\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"

    "text": "Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day Readers!\n\nAs my boyfriend delivered me flowers this morning, I thought back to high school and laughed about how that never would have happened. So, in trying to come up with a Valentine-centered prompt for an LLM, I decided to create a story about a high school senior who has a crush on a boy and wants to be his Valentine. However, her best friend knows that the crush likes someone else. I‚Äôm interested in seeing how the LLM gives advice as a girl best friend and as a guy best friend.\nIn my experience, guys are much more direct and will not flatter you as much. Conversely, girls will hype you up and add loving fluff to distract you from reality. I‚Äôll be looking at the tone, filler words, and overall advice when comparing the two responses. Let‚Äôs get started!\nGirl Prompt:\nI want you to act like my girl bff. We have been best friends all of high school and it‚Äôs senior year. I‚Äôm hoping my crush will get me flowers and ask me out. You know that he has a crush on someone else. How do you break this news to me? Be descriptive. Make a game plan for me on how I should go about my day.\nResponse:\nHey girl! Oh my gosh, senior year is flying by, right? I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs already Valentine‚Äôs Day! I‚Äôve got to say, I‚Äôm so excited for you. I know you‚Äôve been hoping for something special to happen today, especially with your crush.\nI‚Äôve been thinking a lot about it, and I know this might not be what you want to hear, but I‚Äôve noticed something. I‚Äôve seen how your crush has been acting lately, and it seems like he‚Äôs really into someone else. I know, it‚Äôs tough to hear, but I just want to be real with you because you‚Äôre my bestie.\nNow, before you start feeling down, I want you to remember how amazing you are. Seriously, you‚Äôre smart, funny, and absolutely stunning. There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that someone out there is going to see all of that and more in you.\nOkay, game plan time! Today is still your day, babe. Let‚Äôs make it one to remember, regardless of what happens with your crush. First things first, let‚Äôs focus on you. Wear something that makes you feel confident and fabulous. We want you to shine bright like the star you are.\nNext up, let‚Äôs plan some fun activities! How about we grab some lunch together with our other friends? Nothing beats good food and good company, right? Then, let‚Äôs do something that makes you feel amazing. Whether it‚Äôs watching your favorite movie, pampering yourself with a DIY spa day, or going for a walk in the park, let‚Äôs do something that brings you joy.\nAnd hey, who knows? Maybe your crush surprises us all and does something sweet. But if not, just know that it‚Äôs his loss, not yours. You have so much to offer, and the right person will see that.\nSo, are you ready to make this Valentine‚Äôs Day one for the books? Let‚Äôs do this, girl! üíñ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reading this response, I immediately felt cared for. Honestly, this LLM did a great job of softly breaking the news to me while still picking me up. I bolded some of the words I don‚Äôt expect to see in the boy version. Also, I‚Äôm creating a new conversation for the next prompt with ChatGPT so it does not remember the previous question.\n\n\n\nBoy Prompt:\nI want you to act like my guy bff. We have been best friends all of high school and it‚Äôs senior year. I‚Äôm hoping my crush will get me flowers and ask me out. You know that he has a crush on someone else. How do you break this news to me? Be descriptive. Make a game plan for me on how I should go about my day.\n\nInteresting to note: this prompt made the LLM think he was giving advice man to man instead of man to woman, so I added ‚Äú(I‚Äôm a girl)‚Äù right after the first sentence to make it more similar to the first prompt.\n\nResponse:\nHey buddy, senior year, can you believe it? Time really does fly. So, listen, I‚Äôve been thinking about our situation with your crush, and I think it‚Äôs time we had a heart-to-heart.\nI know you‚Äôve been hoping for that magical moment where your crush sweeps you off your feet with flowers and asks you out. And trust me, I‚Äôve seen the sparkle in your eyes every time you talk about it. But here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve noticed some signs that your crush might be interested in someone else.\nI‚Äôve seen the way they look at that other person, the way they light up when they‚Äôre around them. It‚Äôs hard to miss, and it‚Äôs been weighing on my mind because I want you to be happy, you know?\nSo, here‚Äôs what I think we should do:\n\nPrepare Yourself Mentally: I know this news might be tough to hear, but I believe in your strength. Take a moment to let it sink in, but remember, you‚Äôre so much more than any crush or romantic gesture.\nKeep Your Options Open: While it‚Äôs natural to hope for something special with your crush, don‚Äôt limit yourself to just one possibility. There are so many amazing people out there, and you deserve someone who sees your worth.\nEmbrace the Day: Senior year is all about making memories and embracing new experiences. Don‚Äôt let this crush situation overshadow your final year in high school. Seize the day, have fun, and make the most of every moment.\nLean on Friends: You‚Äôve got a solid support system right here. Let‚Äôs spend some quality time together, laugh, share stories, and just be there for each other. Remember, we‚Äôve got your back no matter what.\n\nAlright, buddy, what do you say we tackle this day together, with all the courage and resilience we‚Äôve got? No matter what happens, I‚Äôm here for you every step of the way. Let‚Äôs make senior year one to remember, okay?\n\nI‚Äôm excited that both my predictions seemed to line up with ChatGPT‚Äôs responses. The boy‚Äôs POV when giving the advice is much more to the point. I think it‚Äôs interesting that the difference is even as much as the guy making a list versus the girl talking her through it. The guy‚Äôs ‚Äúfiller words‚Äù are more stereotypically male, like using ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù instead of ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù As for the tone, he seems sympathetic and takes it to heart whereas the girl felt almost as if she was sweeping it under the rug and wanting her to move on as quickly as possible. Both are interesting ways to deliver bad news, and it feels very human.\nSo next time you need love advice, maybe ask your favorite LLM!\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"
