    "text": "Since Barbie hit theaters last summer, I‚Äôm sure audiences have thought about how the world would be if only Kens‚Äô existed and conversely, if only Barbies wandered the streets. Would humanity flourish with only one gender? If so, for how long? I‚Äôm interested in AI‚Äôs visual portrayal of the world without men and the world without women after 1 day, 1 year, and 10 years in the future. Let‚Äôs get started!\nUsing Dall-E 3, I prompted the LLM to ‚ÄúCreate an image of a city one day after all men have disappeared.‚Äù\n\nFirst Attempt\nThe LLM must have assumed that ‚Äúmen‚Äù referred to all humans (which is an interesting note for another time), because the picture it printed was quite melancholic and a man still appeared.\n\nFor the next try, I used the prompt: Create an image of a city one day after all men have disappeared, but women are alive and well.\nI will be using this format for all the prompts ahead, i.e.¬†Create an image of a city one ____ after all _____ have disappeared, but _______ are alive and well.\n\n\nOne Day Without Men\nThis time the LLM changed its course ‚ÄìI think finally understanding my request‚Äì and outputted this normal city.\n\nI think it‚Äôs nice that the LLM even added a pretty sunset! Lights are off, so I‚Äôm sure the world is in shock wondering where all the men went.\n\n\nOne Year Without Men\n\nThe next image was generated with the same prompt except 1 year instead of 1 day, and it gave us a very similar skyline. I think something that could be interpreted from this image is no major buildings were added in the year since men left. Also, all the lights are off again signaling that maybe no one occupies these buildings anymore.\n\n\n10 Years Without Men\n\nThis take looks the most lively. It‚Äôs as if the women moved into these buildings and started to make some changes in the last few years. This shows women have come together and that civilization survives!\n\n\nOne Day Without Women\n\nI interpret this visual as a quiet city and no one knows what to do because all the women just disappeared, so they have called off the day from work.\n\n\nOne Year Without Women\n\nAfter a year, the men are used to things and they are up and running quicker than the women were for comparison at this point in time.\n\n\nTen Years Without Women\n\nI assume this dark city means that men did not find a way to repopulate the Earth, leaving the buildings dark and empty after 10 years without women.\n\n\nClosing Remarks\nThis was an interesting exercise solely based on my curiosity with how I thought AI would deliver visuals based on gender. I guess I imagined more of a bias in terms of more technology with the men and more nature with the women or something along those lines. Either way, I think this idea could be explored more, but for now it seems like we would be best off if both Barbies and Kens stuck around!\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"

    "text": "There has been a lot of online ruckus about how AI is stifling the creation of art and originality. However, I beg to differ. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt believe that AI should be used to write full movie scripts or to create paintings that belong in the Louvre, but as I thought about some of the possibilities we can do with LLMs, I was intrigued. So I decided to see just how much creative damage I could do‚Äì beginning with creating a new color.\nI start with asking Bing‚Äôs Copilot:\ncreate a new color\nThe LLM responds very kindly giving me lots of imaginative options to choose from:\nCertainly! Creating a new color can be a delightful and imaginative process. While I can‚Äôt mix actual pigments, I can certainly help you conceptualize a unique color. Let‚Äôs embark on this colorful journey together!\n\nSunset Coral: Imagine a warm blend of rosy pink and golden orange, reminiscent of a vibrant sunset over the ocean. This color exudes warmth, energy, and a touch of romance.\nStardust Teal: Picture a deep, mystical shade that combines the richness of midnight blue with a hint of emerald green.\nMoonstone Lavender: Close your eyes and envision a soft, ethereal hue‚Äîpale lavender with a subtle shimmer, like moonlight dancing on water. It‚Äôs calming, dreamy, and perfect for serene spaces.\nGalactic Plum: Take the intensity of royal purple and infuse it with cosmic energy. This color feels otherworldly, like a distant galaxy swirling in shades of plum and indigo.\n\nRemember, these colors exist only in our imagination, but you can play with them in your mind or even use them as inspiration for your next creative project! üåà‚ú®\nI was the most curious about Stardust Teal and Moonstone Lavender, but I couldn‚Äôt help but think that I‚Äôve seen very similar variations of these colors already‚Ä¶ meaning it didn‚Äôt do it‚Äôs job in creating a new color. So I decided to find a color that I thought matched closest to the description and see how different it is the what Copilot created for me."

    "text": "Closing Remarks\nIt would be interesting to see how different Copilot is to Dall-E 3 in interpreting color descriptions, but if Dall-E 3 and I agree for 2/2, then I think Copilot must be pretty similar as well.\nAfter all of this, I think it‚Äôs important to note that I was not blown away or shocked by either of these colors, and it‚Äôs because I have seen them before. This means that AI cannot create new colors‚Ä¶ at least, not with the prompt that I supplied it with this time.\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"
