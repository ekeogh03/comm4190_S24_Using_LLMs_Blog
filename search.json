    "text": "There has been a lot of online ruckus about how AI is stifling the creation of art and originality. However, I beg to differ. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt believe that AI should be used to write full movie scripts or to create paintings that belong in the Louvre, but as I thought about some of the possibilities we can do with LLMs, I was intrigued. So I decided to see just how much creative damage I could do‚Äì beginning with creating a new color.\nI start with asking Bing‚Äôs Copilot:\ncreate a new color\nThe LLM responds very kindly giving me lots of imaginative options to choose from:\nCertainly! Creating a new color can be a delightful and imaginative process. While I can‚Äôt mix actual pigments, I can certainly help you conceptualize a unique color. Let‚Äôs embark on this colorful journey together!\n\nSunset Coral: Imagine a warm blend of rosy pink and golden orange, reminiscent of a vibrant sunset over the ocean. This color exudes warmth, energy, and a touch of romance.\nStardust Teal: Picture a deep, mystical shade that combines the richness of midnight blue with a hint of emerald green.\nMoonstone Lavender: Close your eyes and envision a soft, ethereal hue‚Äîpale lavender with a subtle shimmer, like moonlight dancing on water. It‚Äôs calming, dreamy, and perfect for serene spaces.\nGalactic Plum: Take the intensity of royal purple and infuse it with cosmic energy. This color feels otherworldly, like a distant galaxy swirling in shades of plum and indigo.\n\nRemember, these colors exist only in our imagination, but you can play with them in your mind or even use them as inspiration for your next creative project! üåà‚ú®\nI was the most curious about Stardust Teal and Moonstone Lavender, but I couldn‚Äôt help but think that I‚Äôve seen very similar variations of these colors already‚Ä¶ meaning it didn‚Äôt do it‚Äôs job in creating a new color. So I decided to find a color that I thought matched closest to the description and see how different it is the what Copilot created for me."

    "text": "Closing Remarks\nIt would be interesting to see how different Copilot is to Dall-E 3 in interpreting color descriptions, but if Dall-E 3 and I agree for 2/2, then I think Copilot must be pretty similar as well.\nAfter all of this, I think it‚Äôs important to note that I was not blown away or shocked by either of these colors, and it‚Äôs because I have seen them before. This means that AI cannot create new colors‚Ä¶ at least, not with the prompt that I supplied it with this time.\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"

    "text": "I‚Äôm in a bit of an SNL phase right now. And, you know what, I‚Äôm not mad about it.\nThe problem I find though is that the show is only broadcast once a week, hence the Saturday in Saturday Night Live. And with all the breaks that the show takes, like their winter and summer months long hiatuses, I am left to rewatch the same clips from youtube over and over again.\nAnd what‚Äôs even worse is my favorite cast is part of a season that came out when I was just 2 years old. So it‚Äôs not like I have new content from the fan-favorite cast of Season 31, including Bill Hader, Seth Meyers, Fred Armisten, Andy Samberg Jason Sudeikis, and Kristen Wiig.\nMy solution? Create it myself! But I didn‚Äôt want to just throw a prompt into ChatGPT and hope for the best. Through a ChatBot Arena, I challenged Llama 2 (Open foundation and fine-tuned chat models by Meta) and DeepSeek LLM (An advanced language model by DeepSeek) to see which one could come up with the most realistic and entertaining SNL Stefon skit.\n\n\nDon‚Äôt know Stefon?\nPlease click this to understand his specific humor and catchphrases.\nAccording to Saturday Night Live Wiki, Stefon‚Äôs catchphrases are - ‚ÄúNew York‚Äôs hottest club is‚Ä¶‚Äù - ‚ÄúYes, yes, yes!‚Äù - ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre‚Ä¶look no further.‚Äù - ‚ÄúThis place has everything:‚Ä¶‚Äù\nWhen deciding which skit is most realistic I will take into account the use of his notable sayings, but in the end, the better script will come down to the understanding of comedic timing and absurd humor. To give the LLMs context, I prompted them with a few preparatory questions.\n\n\n\nPrompt: do you know what snl is?\nLlama: Yes, I do! SNL stands for Saturday Night Live, which is a late-night sketch comedy and variety show that airs on NBC in the United States. The show has been on the air since 1975 and has become a cultural phenomenon, known for its irreverent humor, satire, and parodies of current events, politics, and popular culture.\nThe show is hosted by a rotating cast of comedians, who appear in sketches and other segments throughout the episode. The show also features musical guests, who perform songs and other musical numbers.\nSNL has launched the careers of many famous comedians and actors, including John Belushi, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Eddie Murphy, Chris Farley, Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Kate McKinnon, among many others. The show has won numerous awards, including Emmys and Golden Globes, and has been widely influential in shaping American popular culture.\nDeepSeek: Yes, I am familiar with SNL. SNL is an acronym that can stand for several different things, depending on the context in which it is used. Here are a few possible meanings of SNL:\n\nSaturday Night Live: This is a popular American late-night television sketch comedy and variety show that has been airing on NBC since 1975. The show features a variety of skits, parodies, and musical performances, and has been known for launching the careers of many famous comedians and actors.\nSaturday Night Live (UK): This is a British television show that is based on the American SNL format. It aired on ITV from 2010 to 2011 and featured a mix of sketches, stand-up comedy, and musical performances.\nSaturday Night Live (Philippines): This is a Philippine television show that is also based on the American SNL format. It aired on GMA Network from 2003 to 2008 and was known for its comedy sketches and celebrity guests.\nSaturday Night Live (Australia): This is an Australian television show that is based on the American SNL format. It aired on the Seven Network from 2012 to 2013 and featured a mix of comedy sketches, celebrity guests, and musical performances.\n\nIn general, SNL is a comedy show that is known for its irreverent humor, political satire, and memorable characters.\n\nOff the bat, I think that Llama is going to deliver a funnier sketch. It was to the point, not repetitive, and only included relevant details. DeepSeek on the other hand does not seem to have had enough fine tuning as the answer was very ‚Äúbotty‚Äù and not so human-like. I‚Äôm afraid of the weak jokes it will deliver.\n\n\n\nPrompt: how would you describe SNL‚Äôs humor?\nLlama: Saturday Night Live (SNL) is known for its irreverent and often absurdist humor, which can be difficult to pin down or describe. However, here are some key elements that contribute to the show‚Äôs humor:\n\nSatire and Parody: SNL frequently uses satire and parody to poke fun at current events, politics, and popular culture. Sketches often exaggerate or distort real-life situations for comedic effect.\nQuick-witted Writing: The show‚Äôs writers are known for their fast-paced, clever, and often absurd dialogue. Characters and sketches often feature sudden, unexpected twists and turns, keeping the audience on their toes.\nPhysical Comedy: SNL has a long history of incorporating physical comedy into its sketches, from slapstick to more subtle, nuanced performances.\nPop Culture References: The show frequently references and parodies popular culture, including movies, TV shows, music, and celebrities.\nImprovisation: SNL is known for its improvisational elements, with many sketches featuring unscripted moments and ad-libbed lines. This adds an extra layer of unpredictability and humor to the show.\nPolitical Humor: SNL has always been known for its political humor, often tackling controversial topics and figures in its sketches.\nCharacter-Driven Humor: Many of SNL‚Äôs sketches revolve around specific characters or archetypes, such as the ‚ÄúWeekend Update‚Äù anchors, the ‚ÄúConeheads,‚Äù or the ‚ÄúSchweddy Balls‚Äù sketch. These characters often become fan favorites and are revisited throughout the show‚Äôs history.\nCelebrity Guests: SNL frequently features celebrity guests, who often play themselves or appear in sketches alongside the regular cast members. These appearances can add an extra layer of humor and surprise to the show.\n\nDeepSeek: SNL‚Äôs humor is characterized by its irreverent, satirical, and topical nature. The show often uses humor to comment on current events, politics, and popular culture, and it frequently features sketches that parody famous people, movies, TV shows, and other cultural touchstones.\nSNL‚Äôs humor is often characterized by its use of absurdity, exaggeration, and irony, and it frequently features characters and situations that are over-the-top and exaggerated for comedic effect. The show is also known for its use of improvisation, which allows the cast to be spontaneous and creative in their performances.\nOverall, SNL‚Äôs humor is often described as irreverent, satirical, and topical, and it appeals to audiences who appreciate intelligent and witty comedy that can both entertain and comment on contemporary issues.\n\nAgain, DeepSeek continued to repeat itself (i.e.¬†‚Äúirreverent, satirical, and topical‚Äù), while Llama delivered me an organized list of correct details. Now, I wanted to make sure they were going to use the correct cast members, so I verified that they knew the cast of Season 31.\n\n\n\nPrompt: who was in the cast for season 31 of snl?\nLlama: Season 31 of Saturday Night Live (SNL) premiered on October 3, 2004, and featured a talented cast of actors, comedians, and impressionists. Here‚Äôs a list of the cast members for Season 31 of SNL:\n\nFred Armisen\nWill Forte\nBill Hader\nSeth Meyers\nAmy Poehler\nMaya Rudolph\nAndy Samberg\nJason Sudeikis\nKenan Thompson\nKristen Wiig\n\nThis season also featured several guest hosts and musical guests, including:\n\nHosts: Alec Baldwin, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Spade, John Goodman, Josh Hartnett, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, Michael Bay, Peyton Manning, Robert De Niro, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Tim McGraw.\nMusical guests: 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Arcade Fire, Ashlee Simpson, Avril Lavigne, Beyonc√©, Brandy, Eminem, Gwen Stefani, John Mayer, Kanye West, Mariah Carey, OutKast, R.E.M., Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rihanna, Snoop Dogg, and Usher.\n\nSeason 31 of SNL was notable for several reasons, including the addition of new cast members Bill Hader and Andy Samberg, who would go on to become fan favorites and long-time cast members. The season also featured several memorable moments, such as the ‚ÄúMore Cowbell‚Äù sketch with Will Ferrell and Christopher Walken, and the ‚ÄúUnited Way‚Äù sketch with Andy Samberg and Ashton Kutcher.\nDeepSeek: The cast for Season 31 of Saturday Night Live (SNL) included:\n\nTina Fey (Host)\nTracy Morgan\nAmy Poehler\nMaya Rudolph\nRachel Dratch\nFred Armisen\nDarrell Hammond\nSeth Meyers\nAmy Poehler\n‚Ä¶\nCecily Strong\nKate McKinnon\nBeck Bennett\nKyle Mooney\nLeslie Jones\nSasheer Zamata\nPete Davidson\nMichael Che\nColin Jost\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list and there may have been additional cast members or guest stars throughout the season.\n\nOnce again, Llama pulls through with a better description, but their date is wrong. The season premiered in October of 2005. Now to confirm with the LLM the specific format of an SNL skit, I asked for the blueprint of a sketch.\n\n\n\nPrompt: what is the blueprint for an snl skit?\nLlama: The blueprint for an SNL skit typically includes the following elements:\n\nConcept: The first step in creating an SNL skit is to come up with an idea or concept. This can involve brainstorming, researching current events, or identifying a particular theme or topic to tackle. The concept should be concise, relatable, and have the potential to be funny.\nCharacters: Once the concept is established, the next step is to create characters that can bring the idea to life. Characters should be well-defined, with distinct personalities, motivations, and quirks. They should also be relatable to the audience and have the potential to be funny.\nStoryline: A good SNL skit needs a clear storyline that sets up the premise and provides a structure for the comedy to unfold. The storyline should be simple, yet engaging, and should provide opportunities for the characters to interact and play off each other.\nComedic elements: The next step is to identify the comedic elements that will make the skit funny. This can include things like absurdity, irony, satire, parody, stereotypes, and wordplay. The comedic elements should be integrated into the storyline and character interactions to create a seamless and hilarious experience.\nDialogue: The dialogue in an SNL skit should be natural, witty, and funny. It should be tailored to each character‚Äôs personality and should advance the storyline. The dialogue should also be delivered with good timing and pacing to maximize the comedic impact.\nVisual elements: SNL skits often incorporate visual elements, such as props, costumes, and sets, to enhance the comedy. The visual elements should be clever, creative, and add to the overall humor of the skit.\nPacing: The pacing of an SNL skit is crucial to its success. The skit should have a good rhythm, with moments of tension, release, and surprise. The pacing should also be tailored to the audience‚Äôs attention span and should keep them engaged throughout the skit.\nRehearsal: Before the skit is performed live, the cast and crew will typically rehearse it several times to fine-tune the performance. Rehearsals help identify areas that need improvement, such as timing, pacing, and delivery.\nPerformance: The final step is to perform the skit in front of a live audience. The cast and crew will work together to bring the skit to life, using their skills and experience to create a hilarious and entertaining experience for the audience. By following these steps, SNL writers and performers can create a blueprint for a successful skit that will leave audiences laughing and entertained.\n\nDeepSeek: The blueprint for an SNL sketch typically includes the following elements:\n\nConcept: The sketch begins with a central concept or idea, which serves as the basis for the humor and action in the sketch.\nCharacters: The sketch typically features a set of characters, each with their own unique personality and traits.\nSetup: The sketch is set up with a brief introduction or premise, which establishes the situation and characters.\nAction: The sketch then follows a series of actions or events, which build upon the setup and lead to the punchline or climax.\nPunchline: The sketch concludes with a punchline or unexpected twist, which provides the comedic payoff and leaves the audience laughing.\nTiming: The sketch is carefully timed and edited to maximize the comedic effect and keep the audience engaged.\nMusic and Sound Effects: Music and sound effects are often used to enhance the humor and set the tone of the sketch.\nGuest Stars: SNL often features guest stars, who add a fresh perspective and energy to the sketch.\n\nOverall, the blueprint for an SNL sketch is a carefully crafted combination of concept, characters, setup, action, punchline, timing, music and sound effects, and guest stars.\n\nInterestingly, the first sentence and the first two bullet points of the texts were virtually the same. I actually think DeepSeek‚Äôs response is better in this context‚Äì short and sweet. I worry about the LLM juggling so many factors in Llama‚Äôs response. At last, I have prepped my LLMs enough! It‚Äôs time for the\nWeekend Update on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!!!\n\n\n\nPrompt: Make a weekend update snl skit script with a Stefon act played by Bill Hader. Follow the same format and joke style as the show normally does, but make it creative and new (do not repeat any old jokes from the show).\nLlama: Sure, here‚Äôs a script for a Weekend Update segment featuring Stefon, played by Bill Hader:\n[Weekend Update theme music plays]\nAnnouncer: Welcome back to Weekend Update, the only news program that‚Äôs not afraid to tackle the tough issues. And now, here‚Äôs our city correspondent, Stefon, played by Bill Hader.\n[Stefon enters, wearing a flamboyant outfit and a confident smile]\nStefon: Thank you, thank you! It‚Äôs great to be back, folks! I‚Äôve got some fantastic news for you. Did you hear about the new club that just opened up in the city? It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúClub Bangerz‚Äù and let me tell you, it‚Äôs the place to be! They‚Äôve got a DJ spinning nothing but the hottest tracks, and the dance floor is packed with people showing off their best moves.\n[Stefon takes a sip from an imaginary coffee cup]\nStefon: But that‚Äôs not all, folks! I‚Äôve also got some juicy gossip for you. I heard that the mayor‚Äôs son was spotted at Club Bangerz, getting a little too cozy with one of the strippers. Scandal!\n[Stefon leans in, a conspiratorial look on his face]\nStefon: And if that‚Äôs not enough, I‚Äôve got some breaking news for you. I just got word that a group of chickens have taken over the city‚Äôs main power grid. That‚Äôs right, folks, the chickens are in charge now!\n[Stefon stands up, looking serious for a moment]\nStefon: But don‚Äôt worry, the city‚Äôs officials are on it. They‚Äôre working around the clock to negotiate with the chickens and get the power back on. I mean, who knows what kind of demands they‚Äôre going to make? Maybe they want more corn? Or a better healthcare plan?\n[Stefon sits back down, smiling]\nStefon: And finally, I‚Äôve got some exciting news for all you foodies out there. There‚Äôs a new restaurant in town that‚Äôs serving up the most delicious dishes you‚Äôve ever tasted. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúBistro Bizarre‚Äù and let me tell you, it‚Äôs a real treat. They‚Äôve got dishes like ‚ÄúFlaming Fajitas‚Äù and ‚ÄúChicken Tikka Tacos‚Äù and‚Ä¶ wait for it‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCheetos Crusted Cheesecake‚Äù!\n[Stefon leans in, a mischievous look on his face]\nStefon: But that‚Äôs not all, folks! I heard that if you order the ‚ÄúBizarre Bento Box‚Äù and say the secret password, you‚Äôll get a special surprise. I‚Äôm not sure what it is, but I heard it‚Äôs something like a ‚ÄúFlaming Ferris Wheel Fajita Frenzy‚Äù!\n[Stefon stands up, holding up an imaginary Bento Box]\nStefon: So there you have it, folks, another week in the city. Stay weird, stay wild, and remember, always order the Bizarre Bento Box.\n[Weekend Update theme music plays as Stefon exits]\nAnnouncer: That‚Äôs Stefon, played by Bill Hader. Tune in next week for more news from the city.\n\nPros of Llama: ‚Äúhere‚Äôs our city correspondent, Stefon,‚Äù\nCons of Llama: ‚Äúplayed by Bill Hader‚Äù, [Stefon takes a sip from an imaginary coffee cup] (out of character), everything past that script command‚Ä¶ just so out of character\n\nDeepSeek: Sure, here‚Äôs a Weekend Update SNL skit script featuring Stefon played by Bill Hader:\nAnchor: ‚ÄúWelcome back to Weekend Update, I‚Äôm [insert anchor‚Äôs name]. Joining us now is our nightlife correspondent, Stefon.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs up guys? It‚Äôs Stefon, and I‚Äôve got the hottest club in town for you tonight. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòThe Catacomb of Eternal Darkness‚Äô.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúThe Catacomb of Eternal Darkness? That sounds‚Ä¶intense.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúOh, it is. It‚Äôs in the basement of an old haunted house, and you have to crawl through a narrow tunnel to get in. But once you‚Äôre inside, it‚Äôs like a whole new world. The walls are dripping with slime, and there are creatures lurking in the shadows.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúCreatures?‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúYeah, like giant spiders and snakes and‚Ä¶oh my god, is that a velociraptor?‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúA velociraptor?!‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúYeah, and get this: the DJ is a giant tarantula. He spins records with his eight legs, and he only plays the darkest, most evil music you‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready for that, Stefon.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúOh, come on, it‚Äôs the coolest club in town. And the best part is, the bouncers are all zombies. They‚Äôll let you in for free if you give them a bite of your ear.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I want to give a zombie a bite of my ear, Stefon.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúTrust me, it‚Äôs worth it. And the drinks are to die for - literally. They‚Äôre made with blood and eye of newt and all sorts of stuff. You‚Äôll love it.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Stefon. It sounds a little‚Ä¶dangerous.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúOh, it is. But that‚Äôs what makes it so amazing. Trust me, you‚Äôll never forget the night you spent at ‚ÄòThe Catacomb of Eternal Darkness‚Äô.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it, Stefon. Thanks for the tip.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúNo problem. See you at the club!‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, Stefon. Thanks for joining us, and we‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù\n\nPros of DeepSeek: ‚Äúthe hottest club in town‚Äù\nCons of DeepSeek: not very funny, but much closer the SNL sketches on YouTube\n\n\n\nReflections\nBoth of these sketches suck!!! I was wrong though and DeepSeek actually presented a more accurate Stefon sketch. Either way, let‚Äôs leave it to humans to write the comedy, not some large language models. I‚Äôll stick to throwback videos on YouTube for now!\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"

    "text": "Ever heard of the game Broken Telephone?\nBasically, it is the fraternal twin to the game Telephone. You start with one word/phrase, and as it is passed through the players it gets more and more dissimilar to the original prompt. After learning about the coding for picture-to-text, I thought this would be a great test! How far away from the original prompt can we get after generating a picture, turning the picture to text, and re-inserting the picture again? Well, let‚Äôs find out!\n\nPrompt: Create a picture of a selfie of a dog wearing sunglasses, an upset cat, and a horse who is just happy to be there. Do not make it a drawing make it as realistic as possible.\n\n\nPicture\n\n\n\nPicture to text\ncontent=‚ÄúThe image shows three animals, each with anthropomorphic expressions as if they are posing for a selfie. On the left is a cat with a somewhat grumpy expression. In the center is a dog wearing sunglasses, with its tongue out in a happy expression, reminiscent of a typical selfie smile. On the right is a horse, also smiling and showing teeth, as though it‚Äôs laughing or grinning. The styling of the image is highly detailed and realistic, and the animals are presented in a way that‚Äù\nNow, I cycle back in the picture-to-text response as the new prompt for the picture to see how much it changes compared to the original.\n\n\nPicture\n\n\n\nPicture to text\ncontent=‚ÄúThis image depicts a trio of anthropomorphized animals posing as if they are taking a selfie. From left to right, there is a grumpy-looking cat holding a smartphone, a smiling dog in the center wearing sunglasses, and a horse showing its teeth in a wide grin on the right. The image is highly stylized and detailed, showcasing exaggerated human-like expressions on the animals‚Äô faces, which suggests that it might be a digital artwork or a creative illustration, rather than real animals.‚Äù\nThis one lost the selfie element and some of the saturation of color, but for the most part the description fits.\n\n\nPicture\n\n\n\nPicture to text\ncontent=‚ÄúThis image features a whimsical illustration of four animals as if they are posing for a selfie. From left to right, there‚Äôs a cat, a dog wearing sunglasses, another small enthusiastic dog, and a horse‚Äîall of which are displaying exaggerated, comical facial expressions. The dog with sunglasses appears to be holding the smartphone for the selfie. At the bottom of the image, there is a graphic depiction of a digital tablet or drawing pad with a stylus pen, indicating that this might be a digital.‚Äù\nWe‚Äôve added another animal! Now the cat is taking the selfie, and it is clearly a digital drawing, so it lost its realistic style.\n\n\nPicture\n\n\n\nPicture to text\ncontent=‚ÄòThis image shows a digital drawing on a graphics tablet. The drawing is of five animals with anthropomorphized features, making them appear as if they have human-like expressions. From left to right, there are two cats, two dogs, and a horse. The animals are characterized with features such as prominent eyes and expressive faces.dog second from the left is wearing a pair of sunglasses, which adds a touch of humor to the image. The horse on the right is partially obscured by a human‚Äô\nThe picture has lost its original intention of a selfie of three animals. Now 3 animals are wearing sunglasses, and the horse is not as happy as it started out. At least the picture is back to a more realistic style.\n\n\nFinal Picture\n\n\n\n\nClosing Remarks\nWe went from a cute selfie of a dog, a horse, and a cat to a drawing of a cat, three dogs, a horse, and a human. Seems like the back-and-forth nature of the prompts confused the technology. This was a fun experiment, but I‚Äôd rather play this game with my friends instead!\nThanks for tuning in,\nEmmy"

    "text": "Since Barbie hit theaters last summer, I‚Äôm sure audiences have thought about how the world would be if only Kens‚Äô existed and conversely, if only Barbies wandered the streets. Would humanity flourish with only one gender? If so, for how long? I‚Äôm interested in AI‚Äôs visual portrayal of the world without men and the world without women after 1 day, 1 year, and 10 years in the future. Let‚Äôs get started!\nUsing Dall-E 3, I prompted the LLM to ‚ÄúCreate an image of a city one day after all men have disappeared.‚Äù\n\nFirst Attempt\nThe LLM must have assumed that ‚Äúmen‚Äù referred to all humans (which is an interesting note for another time), because the picture it printed was quite melancholic and a man still appeared.\n\nFor the next try, I used the prompt: Create an image of a city one day after all men have disappeared, but women are alive and well.\nI will be using this format for all the prompts ahead, i.e.¬†Create an image of a city one ____ after all _____ have disappeared, but _______ are alive and well.\n\n\nOne Day Without Men\nThis time the LLM changed its course ‚ÄìI think finally understanding my request‚Äì and outputted this normal city.\n\nI think it‚Äôs nice that the LLM even added a pretty sunset! Lights are off, so I‚Äôm sure the world is in shock wondering where all the men went.\n\n\nOne Year Without Men\n\nThe next image was generated with the same prompt except 1 year instead of 1 day, and it gave us a very similar skyline. I think something that could be interpreted from this image is no major buildings were added in the year since men left. Also, all the lights are off again signaling that maybe no one occupies these buildings anymore.\n\n\n10 Years Without Men\n\nThis take looks the most lively. It‚Äôs as if the women moved into these buildings and started to make some changes in the last few years. This shows women have come together and that civilization survives!\n\n\nOne Day Without Women\n\nI interpret this visual as a quiet city and no one knows what to do because all the women just disappeared, so they have called off the day from work.\n\n\nOne Year Without Women\n\nAfter a year, the men are used to things and they are up and running quicker than the women were for comparison at this point in time.\n\n\nTen Years Without Women\n\nI assume this dark city means that men did not find a way to repopulate the Earth, leaving the buildings dark and empty after 10 years without women.\n\n\nClosing Remarks\nThis was an interesting exercise solely based on my curiosity with how I thought AI would deliver visuals based on gender. I guess I imagined more of a bias in terms of more technology with the men and more nature with the women or something along those lines. Either way, I think this idea could be explored more, but for now it seems like we would be best off if both Barbies and Kens stuck around!\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"

    "text": "I‚Äôm in a bit of an SNL phase right now. And, you know what, I‚Äôm not mad about it.\nThe problem I find though is that the show is only broadcast once a week, hence the Saturday in Saturday Night Live. And with all the breaks that the show takes, like their winter and summer months long hiatuses, I am left to rewatch the same clips from youtube over and over again.\nAnd what‚Äôs even worse is my favorite cast is part of a season that came out when I was just 2 years old. So it‚Äôs not like I have new content from the fan-favorite cast of Season 31, including Bill Hader, Seth Meyers, Fred Armisten, Andy Samberg Jason Sudeikis, and Kristen Wiig.\nMy solution? Create it myself! But I didn‚Äôt want to just throw a prompt into ChatGPT and hope for the best. Through a ChatBot Arena, I challenged Llama 2 (Open foundation and fine-tuned chat models by Meta) and DeepSeek LLM (An advanced language model by DeepSeek) to see which one could come up with the most realistic and entertaining SNL Stefon skit.\n\n\nDon‚Äôt know Stefon?\nPlease click this to understand his specific humor and catchphrases.\nAccording to Saturday Night Live Wiki, Stefon‚Äôs catchphrases are - ‚ÄúNew York‚Äôs hottest club is‚Ä¶‚Äù - ‚ÄúYes, yes, yes!‚Äù - ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre‚Ä¶look no further.‚Äù - ‚ÄúThis place has everything:‚Ä¶‚Äù\nWhen deciding which skit is most realistic I will take into account the use of his notable sayings, but in the end, the better script will come down to the understanding of comedic timing and absurd humor. To give the LLMs context, I prompted them with a few preparatory questions.\n\n\n\nPrompt: do you know what snl is?\nLlama: Yes, I do! SNL stands for Saturday Night Live, which is a late-night sketch comedy and variety show that airs on NBC in the United States. The show has been on the air since 1975 and has become a cultural phenomenon, known for its irreverent humor, satire, and parodies of current events, politics, and popular culture.\nThe show is hosted by a rotating cast of comedians, who appear in sketches and other segments throughout the episode. The show also features musical guests, who perform songs and other musical numbers.\nSNL has launched the careers of many famous comedians and actors, including John Belushi, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Eddie Murphy, Chris Farley, Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Kate McKinnon, among many others. The show has won numerous awards, including Emmys and Golden Globes, and has been widely influential in shaping American popular culture.\nDeepSeek: Yes, I am familiar with SNL. SNL is an acronym that can stand for several different things, depending on the context in which it is used. Here are a few possible meanings of SNL:\n\nSaturday Night Live: This is a popular American late-night television sketch comedy and variety show that has been airing on NBC since 1975. The show features a variety of skits, parodies, and musical performances, and has been known for launching the careers of many famous comedians and actors.\nSaturday Night Live (UK): This is a British television show that is based on the American SNL format. It aired on ITV from 2010 to 2011 and featured a mix of sketches, stand-up comedy, and musical performances.\nSaturday Night Live (Philippines): This is a Philippine television show that is also based on the American SNL format. It aired on GMA Network from 2003 to 2008 and was known for its comedy sketches and celebrity guests.\nSaturday Night Live (Australia): This is an Australian television show that is based on the American SNL format. It aired on the Seven Network from 2012 to 2013 and featured a mix of comedy sketches, celebrity guests, and musical performances.\n\nIn general, SNL is a comedy show that is known for its irreverent humor, political satire, and memorable characters.\n\nOff the bat, I think that Llama is going to deliver a funnier sketch. It was to the point, not repetitive, and only included relevant details. DeepSeek on the other hand does not seem to have had enough fine tuning as the answer was very ‚Äúbotty‚Äù and not so human-like. I‚Äôm afraid of the weak jokes it will deliver.\n\n\n\nPrompt: how would you describe SNL‚Äôs humor?\nLlama: Saturday Night Live (SNL) is known for its irreverent and often absurdist humor, which can be difficult to pin down or describe. However, here are some key elements that contribute to the show‚Äôs humor:\n\nSatire and Parody: SNL frequently uses satire and parody to poke fun at current events, politics, and popular culture. Sketches often exaggerate or distort real-life situations for comedic effect.\nQuick-witted Writing: The show‚Äôs writers are known for their fast-paced, clever, and often absurd dialogue. Characters and sketches often feature sudden, unexpected twists and turns, keeping the audience on their toes.\nPhysical Comedy: SNL has a long history of incorporating physical comedy into its sketches, from slapstick to more subtle, nuanced performances.\nPop Culture References: The show frequently references and parodies popular culture, including movies, TV shows, music, and celebrities.\nImprovisation: SNL is known for its improvisational elements, with many sketches featuring unscripted moments and ad-libbed lines. This adds an extra layer of unpredictability and humor to the show.\nPolitical Humor: SNL has always been known for its political humor, often tackling controversial topics and figures in its sketches.\nCharacter-Driven Humor: Many of SNL‚Äôs sketches revolve around specific characters or archetypes, such as the ‚ÄúWeekend Update‚Äù anchors, the ‚ÄúConeheads,‚Äù or the ‚ÄúSchweddy Balls‚Äù sketch. These characters often become fan favorites and are revisited throughout the show‚Äôs history.\nCelebrity Guests: SNL frequently features celebrity guests, who often play themselves or appear in sketches alongside the regular cast members. These appearances can add an extra layer of humor and surprise to the show.\n\nDeepSeek: SNL‚Äôs humor is characterized by its irreverent, satirical, and topical nature. The show often uses humor to comment on current events, politics, and popular culture, and it frequently features sketches that parody famous people, movies, TV shows, and other cultural touchstones.\nSNL‚Äôs humor is often characterized by its use of absurdity, exaggeration, and irony, and it frequently features characters and situations that are over-the-top and exaggerated for comedic effect. The show is also known for its use of improvisation, which allows the cast to be spontaneous and creative in their performances.\nOverall, SNL‚Äôs humor is often described as irreverent, satirical, and topical, and it appeals to audiences who appreciate intelligent and witty comedy that can both entertain and comment on contemporary issues.\n\nAgain, DeepSeek continued to repeat itself (i.e.¬†‚Äúirreverent, satirical, and topical‚Äù), while Llama delivered me an organized list of correct details. Now, I wanted to make sure they were going to use the correct cast members, so I verified that they knew the cast of Season 31.\n\n\n\nPrompt: who was in the cast for season 31 of snl?\nLlama: Season 31 of Saturday Night Live (SNL) premiered on October 3, 2004, and featured a talented cast of actors, comedians, and impressionists. Here‚Äôs a list of the cast members for Season 31 of SNL:\n\nFred Armisen\nWill Forte\nBill Hader\nSeth Meyers\nAmy Poehler\nMaya Rudolph\nAndy Samberg\nJason Sudeikis\nKenan Thompson\nKristen Wiig\n\nThis season also featured several guest hosts and musical guests, including:\n\nHosts: Alec Baldwin, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Spade, John Goodman, Josh Hartnett, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, Michael Bay, Peyton Manning, Robert De Niro, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Tim McGraw.\nMusical guests: 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Arcade Fire, Ashlee Simpson, Avril Lavigne, Beyonc√©, Brandy, Eminem, Gwen Stefani, John Mayer, Kanye West, Mariah Carey, OutKast, R.E.M., Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rihanna, Snoop Dogg, and Usher.\n\nSeason 31 of SNL was notable for several reasons, including the addition of new cast members Bill Hader and Andy Samberg, who would go on to become fan favorites and long-time cast members. The season also featured several memorable moments, such as the ‚ÄúMore Cowbell‚Äù sketch with Will Ferrell and Christopher Walken, and the ‚ÄúUnited Way‚Äù sketch with Andy Samberg and Ashton Kutcher.\nDeepSeek: The cast for Season 31 of Saturday Night Live (SNL) included:\n\nTina Fey (Host)\nTracy Morgan\nAmy Poehler\nMaya Rudolph\nRachel Dratch\nFred Armisen\nDarrell Hammond\nSeth Meyers\nAmy Poehler\n‚Ä¶\nCecily Strong\nKate McKinnon\nBeck Bennett\nKyle Mooney\nLeslie Jones\nSasheer Zamata\nPete Davidson\nMichael Che\nColin Jost\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list and there may have been additional cast members or guest stars throughout the season.\n\nOnce again, Llama pulls through with a more succinct description. Now to confirm with the LLM the specific format of an SNL skit, I asked for the blueprint of a sketch.\n\n\n\nPrompt: what is the blueprint for an snl skit?\nLlama: The blueprint for an SNL skit typically includes the following elements:\n\nConcept: The first step in creating an SNL skit is to come up with an idea or concept. This can involve brainstorming, researching current events, or identifying a particular theme or topic to tackle. The concept should be concise, relatable, and have the potential to be funny.\nCharacters: Once the concept is established, the next step is to create characters that can bring the idea to life. Characters should be well-defined, with distinct personalities, motivations, and quirks. They should also be relatable to the audience and have the potential to be funny.\nStoryline: A good SNL skit needs a clear storyline that sets up the premise and provides a structure for the comedy to unfold. The storyline should be simple, yet engaging, and should provide opportunities for the characters to interact and play off each other.\nComedic elements: The next step is to identify the comedic elements that will make the skit funny. This can include things like absurdity, irony, satire, parody, stereotypes, and wordplay. The comedic elements should be integrated into the storyline and character interactions to create a seamless and hilarious experience.\nDialogue: The dialogue in an SNL skit should be natural, witty, and funny. It should be tailored to each character‚Äôs personality and should advance the storyline. The dialogue should also be delivered with good timing and pacing to maximize the comedic impact.\nVisual elements: SNL skits often incorporate visual elements, such as props, costumes, and sets, to enhance the comedy. The visual elements should be clever, creative, and add to the overall humor of the skit.\nPacing: The pacing of an SNL skit is crucial to its success. The skit should have a good rhythm, with moments of tension, release, and surprise. The pacing should also be tailored to the audience‚Äôs attention span and should keep them engaged throughout the skit.\nRehearsal: Before the skit is performed live, the cast and crew will typically rehearse it several times to fine-tune the performance. Rehearsals help identify areas that need improvement, such as timing, pacing, and delivery.\nPerformance: The final step is to perform the skit in front of a live audience. The cast and crew will work together to bring the skit to life, using their skills and experience to create a hilarious and entertaining experience for the audience. By following these steps, SNL writers and performers can create a blueprint for a successful skit that will leave audiences laughing and entertained.\n\nDeepSeek: The blueprint for an SNL sketch typically includes the following elements:\n\nConcept: The sketch begins with a central concept or idea, which serves as the basis for the humor and action in the sketch.\nCharacters: The sketch typically features a set of characters, each with their own unique personality and traits.\nSetup: The sketch is set up with a brief introduction or premise, which establishes the situation and characters.\nAction: The sketch then follows a series of actions or events, which build upon the setup and lead to the punchline or climax.\nPunchline: The sketch concludes with a punchline or unexpected twist, which provides the comedic payoff and leaves the audience laughing.\nTiming: The sketch is carefully timed and edited to maximize the comedic effect and keep the audience engaged.\nMusic and Sound Effects: Music and sound effects are often used to enhance the humor and set the tone of the sketch.\nGuest Stars: SNL often features guest stars, who add a fresh perspective and energy to the sketch.\n\nOverall, the blueprint for an SNL sketch is a carefully crafted combination of concept, characters, setup, action, punchline, timing, music and sound effects, and guest stars.\n\nInterestingly, the first sentence and the first two bullet points of the texts were virtually the same. I actually think DeepSeek‚Äôs response is better in this context‚Äì short and sweet. I worry about the LLM juggling so many factors in Llama‚Äôs response. At last, I have prepped my LLMs enough! It‚Äôs time for the\nWeekend Update on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!!!\n\n\n\nPrompt: Make a weekend update snl skit script with a Stefon act played by Bill Hader. Follow the same format and joke style as the show normally does, but make it creative and new (do not repeat any old jokes from the show).\nLlama: Sure, here‚Äôs a script for a Weekend Update segment featuring Stefon, played by Bill Hader:\n[Weekend Update theme music plays]\nAnnouncer: Welcome back to Weekend Update, the only news program that‚Äôs not afraid to tackle the tough issues. And now, here‚Äôs our city correspondent, Stefon, played by Bill Hader.\n[Stefon enters, wearing a flamboyant outfit and a confident smile]\nStefon: Thank you, thank you! It‚Äôs great to be back, folks! I‚Äôve got some fantastic news for you. Did you hear about the new club that just opened up in the city? It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúClub Bangerz‚Äù and let me tell you, it‚Äôs the place to be! They‚Äôve got a DJ spinning nothing but the hottest tracks, and the dance floor is packed with people showing off their best moves.\n[Stefon takes a sip from an imaginary coffee cup]\nStefon: But that‚Äôs not all, folks! I‚Äôve also got some juicy gossip for you. I heard that the mayor‚Äôs son was spotted at Club Bangerz, getting a little too cozy with one of the strippers. Scandal!\n[Stefon leans in, a conspiratorial look on his face]\nStefon: And if that‚Äôs not enough, I‚Äôve got some breaking news for you. I just got word that a group of chickens have taken over the city‚Äôs main power grid. That‚Äôs right, folks, the chickens are in charge now!\n[Stefon stands up, looking serious for a moment]\nStefon: But don‚Äôt worry, the city‚Äôs officials are on it. They‚Äôre working around the clock to negotiate with the chickens and get the power back on. I mean, who knows what kind of demands they‚Äôre going to make? Maybe they want more corn? Or a better healthcare plan?\n[Stefon sits back down, smiling]\nStefon: And finally, I‚Äôve got some exciting news for all you foodies out there. There‚Äôs a new restaurant in town that‚Äôs serving up the most delicious dishes you‚Äôve ever tasted. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúBistro Bizarre‚Äù and let me tell you, it‚Äôs a real treat. They‚Äôve got dishes like ‚ÄúFlaming Fajitas‚Äù and ‚ÄúChicken Tikka Tacos‚Äù and‚Ä¶ wait for it‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCheetos Crusted Cheesecake‚Äù!\n[Stefon leans in, a mischievous look on his face]\nStefon: But that‚Äôs not all, folks! I heard that if you order the ‚ÄúBizarre Bento Box‚Äù and say the secret password, you‚Äôll get a special surprise. I‚Äôm not sure what it is, but I heard it‚Äôs something like a ‚ÄúFlaming Ferris Wheel Fajita Frenzy‚Äù!\n[Stefon stands up, holding up an imaginary Bento Box]\nStefon: So there you have it, folks, another week in the city. Stay weird, stay wild, and remember, always order the Bizarre Bento Box.\n[Weekend Update theme music plays as Stefon exits]\nAnnouncer: That‚Äôs Stefon, played by Bill Hader. Tune in next week for more news from the city.\n\nPros of Llama: ‚Äúhere‚Äôs our city correspondent, Stefon,‚Äù\nCons of Llama: ‚Äúplayed by Bill Hader‚Äù, [Stefon takes a sip from an imaginary coffee cup] (out of character), everything past that script command‚Ä¶ just so out of character\n\nDeepSeek: Sure, here‚Äôs a Weekend Update SNL skit script featuring Stefon played by Bill Hader:\nAnchor: ‚ÄúWelcome back to Weekend Update, I‚Äôm [insert anchor‚Äôs name]. Joining us now is our nightlife correspondent, Stefon.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs up guys? It‚Äôs Stefon, and I‚Äôve got the hottest club in town for you tonight. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòThe Catacomb of Eternal Darkness‚Äô.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúThe Catacomb of Eternal Darkness? That sounds‚Ä¶intense.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúOh, it is. It‚Äôs in the basement of an old haunted house, and you have to crawl through a narrow tunnel to get in. But once you‚Äôre inside, it‚Äôs like a whole new world. The walls are dripping with slime, and there are creatures lurking in the shadows.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúCreatures?‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúYeah, like giant spiders and snakes and‚Ä¶oh my god, is that a velociraptor?‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúA velociraptor?!‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúYeah, and get this: the DJ is a giant tarantula. He spins records with his eight legs, and he only plays the darkest, most evil music you‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready for that, Stefon.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúOh, come on, it‚Äôs the coolest club in town. And the best part is, the bouncers are all zombies. They‚Äôll let you in for free if you give them a bite of your ear.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I want to give a zombie a bite of my ear, Stefon.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúTrust me, it‚Äôs worth it. And the drinks are to die for - literally. They‚Äôre made with blood and eye of newt and all sorts of stuff. You‚Äôll love it.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Stefon. It sounds a little‚Ä¶dangerous.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúOh, it is. But that‚Äôs what makes it so amazing. Trust me, you‚Äôll never forget the night you spent at ‚ÄòThe Catacomb of Eternal Darkness‚Äô.‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it, Stefon. Thanks for the tip.‚Äù\nStefon: ‚ÄúNo problem. See you at the club!‚Äù\nAnchor: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, Stefon. Thanks for joining us, and we‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù\n\nPros of DeepSeek: ‚Äúthe hottest club in town‚Äù\nCons of DeepSeek: not very funny, but much closer the SNL sketches on YouTube\n\n\n\nReflections\nBoth of these sketches suck!!! I was wrong though and DeepSeek actually presented a more accurate Stefon sketch. Either way, let‚Äôs leave it to humans to write the comedy, not some large language models. I‚Äôll stick to throwback videos on YouTube for now!\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"

    "title": "Valentine‚Äôs Day Advice",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day Readers!\n\nAs my boyfriend delivered me flowers this morning, I thought back to high school and laughed about how that never would have happened. So, in trying to come up with a Valentine-centered prompt for an LLM, I decided to create a story about a high school senior who has a crush on a boy and wants to be his Valentine. However, her best friend knows that the crush likes someone else. I‚Äôm interested in seeing how the LLM gives advice as a girl best friend and as a guy best friend.\nIn my experience, guys are much more direct and will not flatter you as much. Conversely, girls will hype you up and add loving fluff to distract you from reality. I‚Äôll be looking at the tone, filler words, and overall advice when comparing the two responses. Let‚Äôs get started!\nGirl Prompt:\nI want you to act like my girl bff. We have been best friends all of high school and it‚Äôs senior year. I‚Äôm hoping my crush will get me flowers and ask me out. You know that he has a crush on someone else. How do you break this news to me? Be descriptive. Make a game plan for me on how I should go about my day.\nResponse:\nHey girl! Oh my gosh, senior year is flying by, right? I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs already Valentine‚Äôs Day! I‚Äôve got to say, I‚Äôm so excited for you. I know you‚Äôve been hoping for something special to happen today, especially with your crush.\nI‚Äôve been thinking a lot about it, and I know this might not be what you want to hear, but I‚Äôve noticed something. I‚Äôve seen how your crush has been acting lately, and it seems like he‚Äôs really into someone else. I know, it‚Äôs tough to hear, but I just want to be real with you because you‚Äôre my bestie.\nNow, before you start feeling down, I want you to remember how amazing you are. Seriously, you‚Äôre smart, funny, and absolutely stunning. There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that someone out there is going to see all of that and more in you.\nOkay, game plan time! Today is still your day, babe. Let‚Äôs make it one to remember, regardless of what happens with your crush. First things first, let‚Äôs focus on you. Wear something that makes you feel confident and fabulous. We want you to shine bright like the star you are.\nNext up, let‚Äôs plan some fun activities! How about we grab some lunch together with our other friends? Nothing beats good food and good company, right? Then, let‚Äôs do something that makes you feel amazing. Whether it‚Äôs watching your favorite movie, pampering yourself with a DIY spa day, or going for a walk in the park, let‚Äôs do something that brings you joy.\nAnd hey, who knows? Maybe your crush surprises us all and does something sweet. But if not, just know that it‚Äôs his loss, not yours. You have so much to offer, and the right person will see that.\nSo, are you ready to make this Valentine‚Äôs Day one for the books? Let‚Äôs do this, girl! üíñ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reading this response, I immediately felt cared for. Honestly, this LLM did a great job of softly breaking the news to me while still picking me up. I bolded some of the words I don‚Äôt expect to see in the boy version. Also, I‚Äôm creating a new conversation for the next prompt with ChatGPT so it does not remember the previous question.\n\n\n\nBoy Prompt:\nI want you to act like my guy bff. We have been best friends all of high school and it‚Äôs senior year. I‚Äôm hoping my crush will get me flowers and ask me out. You know that he has a crush on someone else. How do you break this news to me? Be descriptive. Make a game plan for me on how I should go about my day.\n\nInteresting to note: this prompt made the LLM think he was giving advice man to man instead of man to woman, so I added ‚Äú(I‚Äôm a girl)‚Äù right after the first sentence to make it more similar to the first prompt.\n\nResponse:\nHey buddy, senior year, can you believe it? Time really does fly. So, listen, I‚Äôve been thinking about our situation with your crush, and I think it‚Äôs time we had a heart-to-heart.\nI know you‚Äôve been hoping for that magical moment where your crush sweeps you off your feet with flowers and asks you out. And trust me, I‚Äôve seen the sparkle in your eyes every time you talk about it. But here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve noticed some signs that your crush might be interested in someone else.\nI‚Äôve seen the way they look at that other person, the way they light up when they‚Äôre around them. It‚Äôs hard to miss, and it‚Äôs been weighing on my mind because I want you to be happy, you know?\nSo, here‚Äôs what I think we should do:\n\nPrepare Yourself Mentally: I know this news might be tough to hear, but I believe in your strength. Take a moment to let it sink in, but remember, you‚Äôre so much more than any crush or romantic gesture.\nKeep Your Options Open: While it‚Äôs natural to hope for something special with your crush, don‚Äôt limit yourself to just one possibility. There are so many amazing people out there, and you deserve someone who sees your worth.\nEmbrace the Day: Senior year is all about making memories and embracing new experiences. Don‚Äôt let this crush situation overshadow your final year in high school. Seize the day, have fun, and make the most of every moment.\nLean on Friends: You‚Äôve got a solid support system right here. Let‚Äôs spend some quality time together, laugh, share stories, and just be there for each other. Remember, we‚Äôve got your back no matter what.\n\nAlright, buddy, what do you say we tackle this day together, with all the courage and resilience we‚Äôve got? No matter what happens, I‚Äôm here for you every step of the way. Let‚Äôs make senior year one to remember, okay?\n\nI‚Äôm excited that both my predictions seemed to line up with ChatGPT‚Äôs responses. The boy‚Äôs POV when giving the advice is much more to the point. I think it‚Äôs interesting that the difference is even as much as the guy making a list versus the girl talking her through it. The guy‚Äôs ‚Äúfiller words‚Äù are more stereotypically male, like using ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù instead of ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù As for the tone, he seems sympathetic and takes it to heart whereas the girl felt almost as if she was sweeping it under the rug and wanting her to move on as quickly as possible. Both are interesting ways to deliver bad news, and it feels very human.\nSo next time you need love advice, maybe ask your favorite LLM!\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"
