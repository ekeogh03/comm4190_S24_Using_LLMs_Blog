    "text": "There has been a lot of online ruckus about how AI is stifling the creation of art and originality. However, I beg to differ. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt believe that AI should be used to write full movie scripts or to create paintings that belong in the Louvre, but as I thought about some of the possibilities we can do with LLMs, I was intrigued. So I decided to see just how much creative damage I could do‚Äì beginning with creating a new color.\nI start with asking Bing‚Äôs Copilot:\ncreate a new color\nThe LLM responds very kindly giving me lots of imaginative options to choose from:\nCertainly! Creating a new color can be a delightful and imaginative process. While I can‚Äôt mix actual pigments, I can certainly help you conceptualize a unique color. Let‚Äôs embark on this colorful journey together!\n\nSunset Coral: Imagine a warm blend of rosy pink and golden orange, reminiscent of a vibrant sunset over the ocean. This color exudes warmth, energy, and a touch of romance.\nStardust Teal: Picture a deep, mystical shade that combines the richness of midnight blue with a hint of emerald green.\nMoonstone Lavender: Close your eyes and envision a soft, ethereal hue‚Äîpale lavender with a subtle shimmer, like moonlight dancing on water. It‚Äôs calming, dreamy, and perfect for serene spaces.\nGalactic Plum: Take the intensity of royal purple and infuse it with cosmic energy. This color feels otherworldly, like a distant galaxy swirling in shades of plum and indigo.\n\nRemember, these colors exist only in our imagination, but you can play with them in your mind or even use them as inspiration for your next creative project! üåà‚ú®\nI was the most curious about Stardust Teal and Moonstone Lavender, but I couldn‚Äôt help but think that I‚Äôve seen very similar variations of these colors already‚Ä¶ meaning it didn‚Äôt do it‚Äôs job in creating a new color. So I decided to find a color that I thought matched closest to the description and see how different it is the what Copilot created for me."

    "text": "Closing Remarks\nIt would be interesting to see how different Copilot is to Dall-E 3 in interpreting color descriptions, but if Dall-E 3 and I agree for 2/2, then I think Copilot must be pretty similar as well.\nAfter all of this, I think it‚Äôs important to note that I was not blown away or shocked by either of these colors, and it‚Äôs because I have seen them before. This means that AI cannot create new colors‚Ä¶ at least, not with the prompt that I supplied it with this time.\nThanks for tuning in!\nEmmy"
