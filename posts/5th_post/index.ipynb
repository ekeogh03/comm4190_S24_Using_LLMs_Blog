    "As my boyfriend delivered me flowers this morning, I thought back to high school and laughed about how that never would have happened. So, in trying to come up with a Valentine-centered prompt for an LLM, I decided to create a story about a high school senior who has a crush on a boy and wants to be his Valentine. However, her best friend knows that the crush likes someone else. I'm interested in seeing how the LLM gives advice as a girl best friend and as a guy best friend."

    "Okay, game plan time! Today is still your day, **babe**. Let's make it one to remember, regardless of what happens with your crush. First things first, let's focus on you. Wear something that makes you feel confident and fabulous. We want you to shine bright like the star you are.\n",

    "\n",
    "I know you've been hoping for that magical moment where your crush sweeps you off your feet with flowers and asks you out. And trust me, I've seen the sparkle in your eyes every time you talk about it. But here's the thing: I've noticed some signs that your crush might be interested in someone else.\n",

    "So, here's what I think we should do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare Yourself Mentally: I know this news might be tough to hear, but I believe in your strength. Take a moment to let it sink in, but remember, you're so much more than any crush or romantic gesture.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keep Your Options Open: While it's natural to hope for something special with your crush, don't limit yourself to just one possibility. There are so many amazing people out there, and you deserve someone who sees your worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Embrace the Day: Senior year is all about making memories and embracing new experiences. Don't let this crush situation overshadow your final year in high school. Seize the day, have fun, and make the most of every moment.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Lean on Friends: You've got a solid support system right here. Let's spend some quality time together, laugh, share stories, and just be there for each other. Remember, we've got your back no matter what.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, **buddy**, what do you say we tackle this day together, with all the courage and resilience we've got? No matter what happens, I'm here for you every step of the way. Let's make senior year one to remember, okay?"

    "I'm excited that both my predictions seemed to line up with ChatGPT's responses. The boy's POV when giving the advice is much more to the point. I think it's interesting that the difference is even as much as the guy making a list versus the girl talking her through it. The guy's \"filler words\" are more stereotypically male, like using \"buddy\" instead of \"girl.\" As for the tone, he seems sympathetic and takes it to heart whereas the girl felt almost as if she was sweeping it under the rug and wanting her to move on as quickly as possible. Both are interesting ways to deliver bad news, and it feels very human.\n",
