    "There has been a lot of online ruckus about how AI is stifling the creation of art and originality. However, I beg to differ. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe that AI should be used to write full movie scripts or to create paintings that belong in the Louvre, but as I thought about some of the possibilities we can do with LLMs, I was intrigued. So I decided to see just how much creative damage I could do-- beginning with creating a new color. "
