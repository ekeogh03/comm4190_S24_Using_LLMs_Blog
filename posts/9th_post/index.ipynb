    "I believe that my family members would look more accurate if I prompted it more specifically. Something I've noticed is that AI-generated images always give pictures of healthy, attractive, and kind humans unless otherwise stated. So for my grandfather, if I added that he has diabetes then I'd be curious if it might be a bit more accurate without adding physical specifics to the prompt. Also, most eyes were blue and most of the men had beards. I wonder if that's because it's easier for AI to give a more human-like photo if more skin is covered. As for the blue eyes, I assume that was the prediction based on the DNA. The closest response I'd say is probably my sister. "
