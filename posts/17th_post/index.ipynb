    "Recently, my class discovered the service SUNO which is a a song lyric and beat-generative AI service to creates songs out of simple prompts. This really intrigued me after talking about it in class, but I didn't realize the entire extent of the website until using it in person. The website is very easy to navigate, clearly showing where to type in your prompt. It gives sample prompts to lead the user in the right direction. I hopped right in though and wanted to see how personalized it was. "

My first thought was about something I would tell my mom in middle school. I would say, \"If every historical event was written like Hamilton, I would actually like history and I would know everything.\" Of course, that's a huge statement to make, but the base behind it was real.
