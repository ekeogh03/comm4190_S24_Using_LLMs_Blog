    "I ideally wanted 3 different prompts: trying to beat your boyfriend, needing to win for my family's wellbeing, and a professional basketball connoisseur trying to beat an LLM. As mentioned in the previous blogs, I ran out of time as I didn't know that the first game had started already. So only comparing the accuracy of the first two prompts, let's hop right in!"

    "First, I just wanted to reflect on my experience in working with the Sports Betting GBT found through ChatGBT 4. It warned me that it was currently trained with knowledge up to December of 2023, but then it assured me that it could still search Google to find relevant information. My next struggle was when I tried to upload the whole bracket for an easy filling process, the LLM immediately got confused. Interestingly, LLMs have not been trained enough to understand bracket play. It sometimes got it right, but it mainly read right to left instead of pairing each bracket up. On top of those issues, sometimes the LLM would repeat the loser as a winner in a future bracket. Overall, the process was very tedious as I had to manually insert multiple pictures of the brackets. Nevertheless, it did give me winners, so at a glance, let's check out the accuracy!"

His favorite team is Ole Miss because he went there for undergrad, so I guess that’s my favorite team too. I just need a good bracket to impress him and to try to beat his bracket.

    "Much like humans, in this experiment, I found that the LLM cracked under pressure. I asked ChatGPT 4 for how they would rank these two prompts on the same intensity scale, and it said Pormpt 1 was a 7 and Prompt 2 was a 10. I did give the LLMs big bulks of information at a time, so if I had all the time in the world I would have gone game by game and asked to focus on certain aspects like program history, season injuries, etc. But I don't have time for that, and Generative AI is supposed to make written tasks more efficient. Alas, I'm from South Carolina so I'm just happy to see that both prompts ended with South Carolina in the championship game."
