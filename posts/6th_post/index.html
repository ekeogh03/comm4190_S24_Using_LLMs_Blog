<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="im-in-a-bit-of-an-snl-phase-right-now.-and-you-know-what-im-not-mad-about-it.">I’m in a bit of an SNL phase right now. And, you know what, I’m not mad about it.</h3>
<p>The problem I find though is that the show is only broadcast once a week, hence the <em>Saturday</em> in Saturday Night Live. And with all the breaks that the show takes, like their winter and summer months long hiatuses, I am left to rewatch the same clips from youtube over and over again.</p>
<p>And what’s even worse is my favorite cast is part of a season that came out when I was just 2 years old. So it’s not like I have new content from the fan-favorite cast of Season 31, including Bill Hader, Seth Meyers, Fred Armisten, Andy Samberg Jason Sudeikis, and Kristen Wiig.</p>
<p>My solution? Create it myself! But I didn’t want to just throw a prompt into ChatGPT and hope for the best. Through a ChatBot Arena, I challenged Llama 2 (Open foundation and fine-tuned chat models by Meta) and DeepSeek LLM (An advanced language model by DeepSeek) to see which one could come up with the most realistic and entertaining SNL Stefon skit.</p>
<p><img src="stefon.png" width="50%"></p>
<section id="dont-know-stefon" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-know-stefon"><em>Don’t</em> know Stefon?</h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NctoAyRDtzU?si=z9egpnPp_TNqrVuR">Please click this to understand his specific humor and catchphrases.</a></p>
<p>According to Saturday Night Live Wiki, Stefon’s catchphrases are - “New York’s hottest club is…” - “Yes, yes, yes!” - “If you’re…look no further.” - “This place has everything:…”</p>
<p>When deciding which skit is most realistic I will take into account the use of his notable sayings, but in the end, the better script will come down to the understanding of comedic timing and absurd humor. To give the LLMs context, I prompted them with a few preparatory questions.</p>

It was to the point, not repetitive, and only included relevant details. DeepSeek on the other hand does not seem to have had enough fine tuning as the answer was very “botty” and not so human-like. I’m afraid of the weak jokes it will deliver.</h4>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompt-what-is-the-blueprint-for-an-snl-skit">Prompt: what is the blueprint for an snl skit?</h3>
<p><strong>Llama:</strong> The blueprint for an SNL skit typically includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concept: The first step in creating an SNL skit is to come up with an idea or concept. This can involve brainstorming, researching current events, or identifying a particular theme or topic to tackle. The concept should be concise, relatable, and have the potential to be funny.</li>
<li>Characters: Once the concept is established, the next step is to create characters that can bring the idea to life. Characters should be well-defined, with distinct personalities, motivations, and quirks. They should also be relatable to the audience and have the potential to be funny.</li>
<li>Storyline: A good SNL skit needs a clear storyline that sets up the premise and provides a structure for the comedy to unfold. The storyline should be simple, yet engaging, and should provide opportunities for the characters to interact and play off each other.</li>
<li>Comedic elements: The next step is to identify the comedic elements that will make the skit funny. This can include things like absurdity, irony, satire, parody, stereotypes, and wordplay. The comedic elements should be integrated into the storyline and character interactions to create a seamless and hilarious experience.</li>
<li>Dialogue: The dialogue in an SNL skit should be natural, witty, and funny. It should be tailored to each character’s personality and should advance the storyline. The dialogue should also be delivered with good timing and pacing to maximize the comedic impact.</li>
<li>Visual elements: SNL skits often incorporate visual elements, such as props, costumes, and sets, to enhance the comedy. The visual elements should be clever, creative, and add to the overall humor of the skit.</li>
<li>Pacing: The pacing of an SNL skit is crucial to its success. The skit should have a good rhythm, with moments of tension, release, and surprise. The pacing should also be tailored to the audience’s attention span and should keep them engaged throughout the skit.</li>
<li>Rehearsal: Before the skit is performed live, the cast and crew will typically rehearse it several times to fine-tune the performance. Rehearsals help identify areas that need improvement, such as timing, pacing, and delivery.</li>
<li>Performance: The final step is to perform the skit in front of a live audience. The cast and crew will work together to bring the skit to life, using their skills and experience to create a hilarious and entertaining experience for the audience. By following these steps, SNL writers and performers can create a blueprint for a successful skit that will leave audiences laughing and entertained.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DeepSeek:</strong> The blueprint for an SNL sketch typically includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concept: The sketch begins with a central concept or idea, which serves as the basis for the humor and action in the sketch.</li>
<li>Characters: The sketch typically features a set of characters, each with their own unique personality and traits.</li>
<li>Setup: The sketch is set up with a brief introduction or premise, which establishes the situation and characters.</li>
<li>Action: The sketch then follows a series of actions or events, which build upon the setup and lead to the punchline or climax.</li>
<li>Punchline: The sketch concludes with a punchline or unexpected twist, which provides the comedic payoff and leaves the audience laughing.</li>
<li>Timing: The sketch is carefully timed and edited to maximize the comedic effect and keep the audience engaged.</li>
<li>Music and Sound Effects: Music and sound effects are often used to enhance the humor and set the tone of the sketch.</li>
<li>Guest Stars: SNL often features guest stars, who add a fresh perspective and energy to the sketch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the blueprint for an SNL sketch is a carefully crafted combination of concept, characters, setup, action, punchline, timing, music and sound effects, and guest stars.</p>

Follow the same format and joke style as the show normally does, but make it creative and new (do not repeat any old jokes from the show).</h3>
<p><strong>Llama:</strong> Sure, here’s a script for a Weekend Update segment featuring Stefon, played by Bill Hader:</p>
<p>[Weekend Update theme music plays]</p>
<p>Announcer: Welcome back to Weekend Update, the only news program that’s not afraid to tackle the tough issues. And now, here’s our city correspondent, Stefon, played by Bill Hader.</p>
<p>[Stefon enters, wearing a flamboyant outfit and a confident smile]</p>
<p>Stefon: Thank you, thank you! It’s great to be back, folks! I’ve got some fantastic news for you. Did you hear about the new club that just opened up in the city? It’s called “Club Bangerz” and let me tell you, it’s the place to be! They’ve got a DJ spinning nothing but the hottest tracks, and the dance floor is packed with people showing off their best moves.</p>
<p>[Stefon takes a sip from an imaginary coffee cup]</p>
<p>Stefon: But that’s not all, folks! I’ve also got some juicy gossip for you. I heard that the mayor’s son was spotted at Club Bangerz, getting a little too cozy with one of the strippers. Scandal!</p>
<p>[Stefon leans in, a conspiratorial look on his face]</p>
<p>Stefon: And if that’s not enough, I’ve got some breaking news for you. I just got word that a group of chickens have taken over the city’s main power grid. That’s right, folks, the chickens are in charge now!</p>
<p>[Stefon stands up, looking serious for a moment]</p>
<p>Stefon: But don’t worry, the city’s officials are on it. They’re working around the clock to negotiate with the chickens and get the power back on. I mean, who knows what kind of demands they’re going to make? Maybe they want more corn? Or a better healthcare plan?</p>
<p>[Stefon sits back down, smiling]</p>
<p>Stefon: And finally, I’ve got some exciting news for all you foodies out there. There’s a new restaurant in town that’s serving up the most delicious dishes you’ve ever tasted. It’s called “Bistro Bizarre” and let me tell you, it’s a real treat. They’ve got dishes like “Flaming Fajitas” and “Chicken Tikka Tacos” and… wait for it… “Cheetos Crusted Cheesecake”!</p>
<p>[Stefon leans in, a mischievous look on his face]</p>
<p>Stefon: But that’s not all, folks! I heard that if you order the “Bizarre Bento Box” and say the secret password, you’ll get a special surprise. I’m not sure what it is, but I heard it’s something like a “Flaming Ferris Wheel Fajita Frenzy”!</p>
<p>[Stefon stands up, holding up an imaginary Bento Box]</p>
<p>Stefon: So there you have it, folks, another week in the city. Stay weird, stay wild, and remember, always order the Bizarre Bento Box.</p>
<p>[Weekend Update theme music plays as Stefon exits]</p>
<p>Announcer: That’s Stefon, played by Bill Hader. Tune in next week for more news from the city.</p>

<p><strong>DeepSeek:</strong> Sure, here’s a Weekend Update SNL skit script featuring Stefon played by Bill Hader:</p>
<p>Anchor: “Welcome back to Weekend Update, I’m [insert anchor’s name]. Joining us now is our nightlife correspondent, Stefon.”</p>
<p>Stefon: “Hey, what’s up guys? It’s Stefon, and I’ve got the hottest club in town for you tonight. It’s called ‘The Catacomb of Eternal Darkness’.”</p>
<p>Anchor: “The Catacomb of Eternal Darkness? That sounds…intense.”</p>
<p>Stefon: “Oh, it is. It’s in the basement of an old haunted house, and you have to crawl through a narrow tunnel to get in. But once you’re inside, it’s like a whole new world. The walls are dripping with slime, and there are creatures lurking in the shadows.”</p>
<p>Anchor: “Creatures?”</p>
<p>Stefon: “Yeah, like giant spiders and snakes and…oh my god, is that a velociraptor?”</p>
<p>Anchor: “A velociraptor?!”</p>
<p>Stefon: “Yeah, and get this: the DJ is a giant tarantula. He spins records with his eight legs, and he only plays the darkest, most evil music you’ve ever heard.”</p>
<p>Anchor: “I don’t know if I’m ready for that, Stefon.”</p>
<p>Stefon: “Oh, come on, it’s the coolest club in town. And the best part is, the bouncers are all zombies. They’ll let you in for free if you give them a bite of your ear.”</p>
<p>Anchor: “I’m not sure I want to give a zombie a bite of my ear, Stefon.”</p>
<p>Stefon: “Trust me, it’s worth it. And the drinks are to die for - literally. They’re made with blood and eye of newt and all sorts of stuff. You’ll love it.”</p>
<p>Anchor: “I don’t know, Stefon. It sounds a little…dangerous.”</p>
<p>Stefon: “Oh, it is. But that’s what makes it so amazing. Trust me, you’ll never forget the night you spent at ‘The Catacomb of Eternal Darkness’.”</p>
<p>Anchor: “I’ll think about it, Stefon. Thanks for the tip.”</p>
<p>Stefon: “No problem. See you at the club!”</p>
<p>Anchor: “I don’t think so, Stefon. Thanks for joining us, and we’ll be right back.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pros of DeepSeek: “the hottest club in town”</p></li>
<li><p>Cons of DeepSeek: not very funny, but much closer the SNL sketches on YouTube</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections">Reflections</h3>
<p>Both of these sketches suck!!! I was wrong though and DeepSeek actually presented a more accurate Stefon sketch. Either way, let’s leave it to humans to write the comedy, not some large language models. I’ll stick to throwback videos on YouTube for now!</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in!</p>
