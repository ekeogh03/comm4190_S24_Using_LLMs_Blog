    "Everyone has experienced a moment where a text they sent wasn't interpreted the way they meant it to be. Here's a funny sketch that encapsulates this message: https://youtu.be/sngRrkQayDA?si=vIFjTutEoT-l8uiO. Anyway, I thought it would be interesting to see if LLMs can read conversation-like tones that we would normally be able to understand. Going further, maybe the more trained LLMs can but maybe not the beginning ones. "
